# for loops

Try the following statements in the console:
```
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log('hello world');
}
```
Output: 5 hello world

Note: The console won't necessarily print out the statement 5 times. Instead it will likely put a number next to the statement showing how many times the statement would print out.
